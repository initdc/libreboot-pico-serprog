# pico-serprog

Slightly less terrible serprog implementation for the Raspberry Pi Pico and
possibly other RP2040 based boards. Based on pico-serprog by GitHub user
"stacksmashing". Further improved by "kukrimate".

This takes about 17 seconds to read the 8MiB BIOS chip of an X200.

Pinout for the SPI lines:
| Pin | Function |
|-----|----------|
| GP5 | CS       |
| GP4 | MISO     |
| GP3 | MOSI     |
| GP2 | SCK      |

## Compiling

```
cmake .
make
```

Plug in your Pico. Mount it as you would any other USB flash drive.
Copy `pico_serprog.uf2` into it. Your programmer is now ready.
If you want to change the firwmare, you need to press the button
on the board while you plug it in.

## Usage

Substitute ttyACMx with the actual tty device corresponding to the firmware.
You can find this by running `dmesg -wH`. When you plug in the device, a line
containing something like this will appear:

```
[453876.669019] cdc_acm 2-1.2:1.0: ttyACM0: USB ACM device
```


Read chip:

```
flashrom -p serprog:dev=/dev/ttyACMx,spispeed=32M -r flash.bin
```

Write chip:
```
flashrom -p serprog:dev=/dev/ttyACMx,spispeed=32M -w flash.bin
```
